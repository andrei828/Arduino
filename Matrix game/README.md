# Matrix game

The game is a simplified version of the game we all play on Google Chrome
when internet is down.

Essentially, the player is a dot, and obstacles come your way and you have to jump over them. The time alive and the score are tracked and you have a number of lives. The speed can also be adjusted in the settings.

### The game uses:
* Arduino Uno
* 8x8 LED matrix
* LCD display
* Joystick

### How to play
This is a two player game where one is using the joystick to jump over obstacles and the other spawns obstacles at the push of a button
You can select the starting level from the settings (Speed is proportional with the current level). The goal is to beat the high-score (stored in EEPROM inside the Arduino board)
